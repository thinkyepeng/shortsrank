    <p><b>Information Collected Automatically:</b> When you interact with or use our Services, we automatically
      collect
      certain information about your device and your use of our Services. This could include information such as your,

      sever log information, your connections and interactions with other users, purchase histories with us and social
      media data (if you have linked your account and in accordance with your sharing permissions). We (or the third
      parties we work with) use standard tracking technologies (like log files, software development kits (SDKs) and
      web
      beacons) to do this. In addition, we or our partners may also use tracking technologies and advertising IDs to
      serve personalized ads to you in our Services. Please see the section below relating to Tracking Technologies
      [INSERT LINK TO COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES SECTION] for more details.</p>
    <p><span class="undeline">Mobile Platforms:</span> When you use any of our mobile applications, we or third party
      partners will collect and process certain information about you, including your unique device ID (persistent /
      non-persistent), hardware type, device maker, media access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile
      equipment
      identity (“IMEI”), the type and version of your operating system (“OS”), language of the OS, your unique device
      ID, your time zone, the screen size of your device, mobile device Advertising ID (known as “IDFA” for iOS
      devices,
      or “Android Advertising ID” for Android devices), your general geolocation information (city/country based on
      your
      Internet Protocol (“IP”) address) and your email address (if you have connected to Facebook or Google+). This
      information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends so that we can improve and
      personalize the Services for our users. Device identifier / information such as device type, hardware model,
      device maker, device operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size, or combination
      of
      this data, is also collected and used to determine device compatibility and optimal settings. We may also share
      this information with our advertising partners to enable the technical delivery of personalized ads to your
      device, as further described below [LINK TO INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING SECTION].</p>
    <p><span class="undeline">User ID:</span> When you register to use the Services, we create a unique user ID to
      track
      your use of our Services. </p>
    <p><span class="undeline">Mobile Analytics:</span> Like most mobile applications, we use mobile analytics tools to
      collect certain information about your usage of our mobile applications, as well as on your device and the
      health
      of our Services to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Services on your device and for app
      optimization purposes. Such tools may record information such as how often you use the application, feature
      usage,
      and usage statistics, events that occur within the application, aggregated usage and performance data, and where
      the application was downloaded from (i.e. which application store).</p>
    <p>We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any information that personally
      identifies you within the mobile application.</p>
    <h3>Our Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information Automatically</h3>
    <strong>A. Tracking Technologies</strong>
    <p>We and our third party partners, affiliates, or analytics service providers use standard tracking technologies
      (like web beacons, SDKs, APIs, scripts and tags) to identify your computer/device, to “remember” things about
      your
      visit or your use of the Services (such as your preferences or a user name) and to help us understand things
      like,
      what pages and features you use.</p>
    <p>
      Such information may be linked to or combined with other personal information we process about you, such as your
      user ID, for purposes such as improving the quality of our Services, tailoring recommendations to your
      interests,
      providing and personalizing our Services including making our Services easier to use, and for fraud prevention,
      security and authentication purposes.
    </p>
    <p>Please refer to guidance provided by your device manufacturer, operating system developer, or individual web
      browser if you would like help in managing your preferences with respect to tracking technologies used on our
      Services.</p>
    <strong>B. Interest-Based Advertising</strong>
    <p>Some of our Services employ ad-serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels,
      and other similar technologies to deliver interest-based advertising to you about third party products and
      services.</p>
    <div> When you use our apps, some third party tools (SDKs) integrated within our Services may collect and use
      certain information collected from your device for the purpose of ad display and optimization. Such information
      includes GAID (Google Advertising ID on Android devices) or IDFA (Identifier for Advertising on iOS devices),
      region (i.e. the location where a given language is used), geo-location information (with your consent) and IP
      address. This Policy does not govern our third-party advertising partners, as they have their own privacy
      policies, which are accessible using the links provided below. We have no access to or control over such third
      parties. In addition to identifiers, these third parties may also collect information relating to:
      <ul>
        <li>Advertisements served and the location of the ad;</li>
        <li>Length of time an advertisement was visible;</li>
        <li>Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and</li>
        <li>Click-throughs (i.e. whether a click was made on the ad) and advertisement response.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>They use this information (alone or in combination with information they have collected about you when you use
      third party websites or services) to: (i) enable the technical delivery of ads to your device and to verify
      click-throughs and/or installs; (ii) provide you with more relevant ads about our Services; (iii) enable offer
      walls, which allow you to choose from various rewarded ad or market research offers; (iv) track results and
      measure the effectiveness of ads; and (iv) improve the accuracy of their targeting and measurement systems. </p>
    <p>You can learn more about ad serving companies and the options available to limit their collection and use of
      your
      information by visiting the websites for the <span class="underline">Network Advertising Initiative</span> and
      the
      <span class="underline">Digital Advertising Alliance</span>, and the webpages for <span
        class="underline">Facebook's ad preferences tool</span> and <span class="underline">privacy policy.</span>
      Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks
      through your device settings and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device.
    </p>
    <p>Please note: adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive
      advertisements, it only means the ads you do see will be less relevant to your interests. Our advertising
      partners
      will also still use your device’s advertising ID to serve you with ads that may be less relevant to you; for
      example, we may use this for frequency capping (in other words, to control the maximum number of times you see
      the
      same ad from us). You may also reset the Advertising ID associated with your device by following instructions
      provided by your device manufacturer or operating system developer.</p>
    <strong>C. Analytics Technologies</strong>
    <p>We use third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our Services, your computer
      or
      device and the health of our Services.</p>
    <p>For instance, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre
      Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA), on our Services. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking
      technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Services, compile reports on the Services’
      activity , and provide other services related to our Services’ activity and usage. The technologies used by
      Google
      may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit and whether you are a return visitor. The
      Services
      do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by
      Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies.

      <p>We do not sell personal information about our users or players. However, we permit certain third party

        or
        IDFA (Identifier for Advertising on iOS devices), region (i.e. the location where a given language is used),
        geo-location information (with your consent) and IP address. For more information or to opt out of the use of

    <strong>Your Privacy Rights</strong>
    <p>Under the CCPA, California residents have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="underline">Right to Know:</span> You have the right to request that we disclose to you the
        personal information we have collected, used and disclosed over the past 12 months, and information about our
        data practices;</li>
      <li><span class="underline">Right to Request Deletion:</span> You have the right to request that we delete your
        personal information that we have collected from you;</li>
      <li><span class="underline">Right to Non-Discrimination:</span> We will not discriminate against you for
        exercising any of these rights.</li>
      <li><span class="underline">Right to Opt-Out of Sales:</span> We do not sell personal information, so we do not
        have an opt-out.</li>
      <li><span class="underline">Right to be Notified of Financial Incentives:</span> You have the right to be
        notified
        of any financial incentives offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any

        any such incentives at this time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>California law also permits you to request certain information regarding the disclosure of your personal
      information by us and our related companies to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
      We
      do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently
      respond to "Do Not Track" signals. However, we provide you with the ability to opt-out of the use of tracking
      technologies to send you interest-based advertising as explained above.</p>
    <p>To exercise any of the above rights, or if you are an agent authorized to exercise a right under the CCPA, you
      can email <span class="blue">support@shortsrank.com</span> or contact us by mail at the address provided below.
    </p>
    <p>Please note that to protect your information, we may need to verify your identity before processing your
      request.
      In some cases, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as a government
      issued
      ID.</p>
    <p>Under the CCPA, you may exercise these rights yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to make these
      requests on your behalf. We may request that your authorized agent have written permission from you to make
      requests on your behalf and may need to verify your authorized agent’s identity.</p>
    <p>For more information about our privacy practices, you may email support@shortsrank.com.</p>

      to
      appropriate safeguards.</p>
