    <p>You are expressly prohibited from engaging in monetization or profiting from your use of the Service.</p>
    <p>ShortsRank hereby reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms of Use.</p>
    <strong>J. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringements</strong>
    <p>ShortsRank respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of intellectual property very
      seriously, and we ask our users to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the
      Service.</p>
    <p>Shortsshow’s intellectual property policy is to remove or disable access to material that ShortsRank believes in
      good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual
      property of a third party by being made available through the Service.</p>
    <p>ShortsRank has discretion to terminate the Account of any user after receipt of a single notification of claimed
      infringement or upon Shortsshow’s own determination.</p>
    <p>If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner
      that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a <b>"Notification of
        Claimed Infringement"</b> containing the following information to the Copyright Agent identified below. Your
      Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by ShortsRank with the user alleged to have infringed a right
      you own or control, and you hereby consent to ShortsRank making such disclosure. Your communication must include
      substantially the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that
        has/have been allegedly infringed;</li>
      <li>Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single
        notification, then a representative list of such works;</li>
      <li>Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing
        activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient
        to permit ShortsRank to locate the material;</li>
      <li>
        Information reasonably sufficient to permit ShortsRank to contact you, such as an address, telephone number and,
        if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;
      </li>
      <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not
        authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and</li>
      <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are
        authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should consult with your own lawyer to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed
      infringement.</p>
    <p>Via email: <span class="blue">support@shortsrank.com</span> </p>
    <p>Regarding counter notification, if you receive a notification from ShortsRank that material made available by you
      on or through the Service has been the subject of a notification of claimed infringement, then you will have the
      right to provide ShortsRank with what is called a "counter notification." To be effective, a Counter Notification
      must be in writing, provided to Shortsshow’s Copyright Agent through one of the methods identified above and
      include substantially the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;</li>
      <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at
        which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>
      <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed
        or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</li>
      <li>The subscriber's name, address and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the
        jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the
        subscriber's address is outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which ShortsRank may be
        found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under
        Section 9.d above or an agent of such person.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A party submitting a counter notification should consult a lawyer to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a
      valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.</p>
    <p>If you submit a counter notification to ShortsRank in response to a notification of claimed infringement, then
      ShortsRank will promptly provide the person who provided the notification of claimed infringement with a copy of
      your counter notification and inform that person that ShortsRank will replace the removed User Content or feedback
      or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and ShortsRank will replace the removed User Content or
      feedback and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of
      the counter notification, unless Shortsshow’s Copyright Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the
      notification of claimed infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the
      User from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Shortsshow’s system or network.</p>
    <p>The U.S. Copyright Act provides that:</p>
    <p>Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act] (1) that material or
      activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification,
      shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any
      copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such
      misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or
      disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or
      ceasing to disable access to it.</p>
    <p>ShortsRank reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a notification of claimed infringement
      or counter notification in violation of the law.</p>

    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability

      the extent that ShortsRank or any other ShortsRank Party may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any
      warranty, limit or exclude its liability or the scope and duration of such warranty as set forth in these Terms of
      Service, Shortsshow’s and such ShortsRank Party’s liability shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable
      law.</p>
    <strong>S. Indemnification:</strong>
    <p>You will be responsible for and agree to indemnify, defend and hold the ShortsRank Parties harmless from and

      States. ShortsRank makes no representation that the Service is appropriate or available in other locations. The
      information and materials provided on the Service are not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
      entity in any jurisdiction where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would
      subject ShortsRank to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons
      who choose to access the Service from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for
      compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

      or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.</p>

      between you and ShortsRank as a result of these Terms of Use or your use of the Service.</p>
    <p><b>These Terms are the entire agreement between us:</b> These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement
      between you and ShortsRank with respect to your use of the Service and any other subject matter hereof and cannot
      be changed or modified by you except as expressly posted on the Site or the mobile application by ShortsRank.</p>
    <p><b>Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later:</b> The failure of ShortsRank to
      exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
      provision, and no waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
      preceding or subsequent breach or default.</p>
    <p><b>If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force:</b> If any provision of these
      Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
      court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
      provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the
      parties nor trade practice will act to modify these Terms of Use.</p>

      legal importance. Upon Shortsshow’s request, you will furnish ShortsRank any documentation, substantiation or
      releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms of Use. You agree that these Terms of Use will not
      be construed against ShortsRank by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
      have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute
      these Terms of Use. A person who is not a party to this agreement shall have no right to enforce any of its terms.
